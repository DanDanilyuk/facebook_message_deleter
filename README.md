# Delete Facebook Messages

This script allows you to delete all your Facebook messages with just a few clicks. It works by clicking the "Delete" button for each message and then confirming the deletion.

## How to use

1. Go to your Facebook messages page.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to load all your messages.
3. Open the browser console by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + J` (Mac).
4. Copy the contents of `delete_messages.js` or `delete_messages.min.js` file and paste it into the console and press Enter.

Note: You can find the `delete_messages.js` or `delete_messages.min.js` file in the same directory where you found this README.md file.
